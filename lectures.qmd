## Lecture Slides

Lecture slides are available as self-contained `.html` files made with RevealJS from a Quarto `.qmd` file. You can choose to print these to a PDF document by using the "PDF Export Mode" in the Tools menu accessed via the settings button in the lower left-hand side of the page. You are also welcome to directly download the `.qmd` file and supporting data/images/etc... from the Github repository. Slides are organized by week and combine Monday and Wednesday's lectures.
