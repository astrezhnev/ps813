## Course Overview

Questions of cause and effect are central to the study of political science and to the social sciences more broadly. But making inferences about causation from empirical data is a significant challenge. Critically, there is no simple, assumption-free process for learning about a causal relationship from the data alone. Causal inference requires researchers to make assumptions about the underlying data generating process in order to identify and estimate causal effects. The goal of this course is to provide students with a structured statistical framework for articulating the assumptions behind causal research designs and for estimating effects using quantitative data.

The course begins by introducing the counterfactual framework of causal inference as a way of defining causal quantities of interest such as the "average treatment effect." It then proceeds to illustrate a variety of different designs for identifying and estimating these quantities. We will start with the most basic experimental designs and progress to more complex experimental and observational methods. For each approach, we will discuss the necessary assumptions that a researcher needs to make about the process that generated the data, how to assess whether these assumptions are reasonable, how to interpret the quantity being estimated and ultimately how to conduct the analysis.

This course will involve a combination of lectures and problem sets. Problem sets will contain a mixture of both theoretical and applied questions and serve to reinforce key concepts and allow students to assess their progress and understanding throughout the course. Assignments will involve analysis of data using the {{< fa brands r-project >}} programming language. This is a free and open source language for statistical computing that is used extensively for data analysis in many fields. Prior experience with the fundamentals of {{< fa brands r-project >}} programming is required.

## Prerequisites

This course is the second in the political science graduate methodology sequence. Completing the introductory course prior to this sequence should prepare you for the material in this class. We will rely on some background knowledge of core concepts in probability, statistics and inference as well as experience with statistical programming in {{< fa brands r-project >}}. However, there are no strict, specific course pre-requisites as many different disciplines and departments offer introductory statistics classes that cover the relevant material.

In general, you should have had some introduction to probability theory and should be familiar with concepts like the properties of random variables (especially expectation and variance), estimands and estimators, and statistical inference. Familiarity with linear regression is also a plus, but we will be reviewing it during the relevant week.

Please contact the instructor if you are interested in enrolling but are unsure of the requirements.

## Logistics

- **Lectures**: Mondays/Wednesdays from 9:30am-10:45am

You should attend lectures regularly as they comprise a significant element of the course instruction. Lecture materials will be posted on the course website.

- **Discussion Forum**: We will be using [Ed](https://edstem.org/) as our primary course discussion platform. If you are enrolled in the class on Canvas, you should already have access to the Ed board for this class. Please use this to post questions about the readings/lecture material as well as about the problem sets.

- **Course Materials**: Lecture materials, problem sets and tutorial code will be posted on the course website. Problem set solutions will be posted after the due date on Canvas. Links to readings can be found on the course website organized by week.

## Textbooks

The course will involve readings from a variety of different textbooks and published papers. The class will not require the purchase of a single, specific, text and all excerpts from textbooks are available online (either directly or through library resources). However, you may wish to obtain some of these texts to use as a personal reference and they may be valuable to you in the future.

## Grading

Students' final grades are based on four components:

### Problem Sets (25%)

Students will complete a total of five problem sets throughout the quarter. Problem sets will cover roughly a two-week period of course material. A complete schedule of the assignments can be found on the [Assignments](assignments.qmd) page.

The goal of the problem sets is to encourage exploration of the material and to provide you with a clear and credible means of assessing your understanding and progress through the course. As such, problem sets are *designed* to be challenging and we expect students to find some questions difficult.

Problem sets will be graded on a (+/✓/-) scale:

- **+** : Complete and near-perfect work
- **✓** : Generally good work with clear effort shown but with notable errors
- **-** : Significantly incomplete work with major conceptual errors and little effort shown

#### Collaboration Policy

We strongly encourage collaboration between students on the problem sets and highly recommend that students discuss problems with each other either in person or via the discussion forum. However, each student is expected to submit their own write-up of the answers and any relevant code.

#### Office Hours and Online Discussion

Students should feel free to discuss any questions about the problem sets with the teaching staff during sections and office hours. We also strongly encourage students to post questions about both the problem sets and the assigned readings on the course discussion board and respond to other students' questions. Responding to other students' questions will contribute to your participation grade.

#### Submission Guidelines

Problem sets will be distributed as HTMl and Quarto files (`.qmd`). You should submit your answers and any relevant R code in the same format: including the Quarto file (`.qmd` extension) and a corresponding rendered `.html` file as your submission. You will be submitting your problem sets via [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/).

### In-person Midterm (30%)

We will have an in-person midterm examination on **Wednesday, March 4th, 2026**. This exam will cover the material in the first half of the course (experiments and selection-on-observables)  The exam will take the form of a standard pen-and-paper timed examination involving both theory and practical analysis of sample code and results. 

### In-person Final (35%)

The final exam will take place in person during exams week. We have been assigned an exam date of **May 4, 2026** at **5:05PM - 7:05PM**. Room information will be made available nearer to the end of the semester. The exam will take the same form as the midterm, but will be slightly longer given the additional time available during the exam period.

### Participation (10%)

We expect students to take an active role in learning in both lecture and section. Engagement with the teaching staff by asking and answering questions will contribute to this grade as will interaction on the discussion board.

## Computing

This course will use the R programming language. This is a free and open source programming language that is available for nearly all computing platforms. You should download and install it from [https://www.r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org).

Unless you have strong preferences for a specific coding environment, we recommend that you use the free [RStudio](https://rstudio.com) Desktop Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which you can download from [https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).

In addition to base R, we will be frequently using data management and processing tools found in the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) set of packages along with basic graphics and visualization using [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/).

See the [Resources](resources.qmd) page for additional information. 

## Policy on Generative Large Language Models

Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to have an immense impact on the educational field. Over the last several years, we have seen striking growth in the capabilities of these models and it is clear that they will remain a permanent and inextricable presence in all of our lives. This very course website has been built with considerable assistance from Claude's Opus 4.5 model. Having taught a causal inference course every year since 2020, I have seen first-hand how these tools are rapidly reshaping how students engage with the material - for better and for worse. 

It is clear that any restrictions on LLM use aside from *restricted, in-class pen-and-paper examination* use are fundamentally unenforceable. Therefore, with respect to the problem sets, students are permitted to use LLMs in whatever capacity they see fit.


## Accommodations and Accessibility

The University of Wisconsin–Madison supports the right of all enrolled students to a full and equal educational opportunity. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Wisconsin State Statute (36.12), and UW–Madison policy (Faculty Document 1071) require that students with disabilities be reasonably accommodated in instruction and campus life. Reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities is a shared faculty and student responsibility. 

Students are expected to inform faculty of their need for instructional accommodations by the end of the third week of the semester, or as soon as possible after a disability has been incurred or recognized. 

I will work either directly with you or in coordination with the [McBurney Disability Resource Center](https://mcburney.wisc.edu/) to identify and provide reasonable instructional accommodations. Once you are approved for accommodations by the McBurney Center, please be sure to make the relevant selections in [McBurney Connect](https://mcburney.wisc.edu/mcburneyconnect/). When I have received your Student Accommodation Letter, I will send you a follow-up e-mail to connect and discuss how the accommodations will be implemented for this course. Disability information, including instructional accommodations as part of a student’s educational record, is confidential and protected under FERPA.
