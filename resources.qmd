## Software

### R and RStudio

This course uses R for all programming assignments. You are welcome to use the RStudio Interactive Development Environment (IDE) to write code and edit the assignment write-up. Due to the extensive integration of Quarto into Posit-developed IDEs, I encourage using either RStudio or the more recent Positron IDE.

- **R:** Download from [https://www.r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org)
- **RStudio:** Download from [https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
- **Positron:** Download from [https://positron.posit.co/](https://positron.posit.co/)

#### Recommended Guides for R Programming

- **R For Data Science** Available at [https://r4ds.hadley.nz/](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)
- **Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction** Available at [https://socviz.co/](https://socviz.co/)

### Quarto and Markdown

The assignments are distributed as `.qmd` Quarto files. [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is the successor to R Markdown and lets you present your analysis, code, figures and written discussion all in a single document. It uses Markdown syntax for formatting text and supports embedded R code chunks that execute when you render the document. This lets you present your analysis, code, figures, and written discussion all in one place.

To complete assignments, you will edit the provided `.qmd` file, adding your code and written responses, then render it to an HTML file for submission. Both your `.html` output and `.qmd` file will be submitted via Gradescope

- **Quarto:** Download from [https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)
- **Quarto Guide:** [https://quarto.org/docs/guide/](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/)
- **Markdown Basics:** [https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html)
- Note also the [chapter on Quarto](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto.html) in **R For Data Science**
