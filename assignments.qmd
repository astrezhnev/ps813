## Problem Sets

Problem sets will be distributed as PDF and Rmarkdown files (.Rmd). You should submit your answers and any relevant R code in the same format: including an Rmarkdown file (.Rmd extension) and a corresponding rendered .pdf file.

### Submission Guidelines

1. Download the problem set from the course GitHub repository
2. Complete your work in the provided .Rmd template
3. Render your document to PDF
4. Submit both the .Rmd and .pdf files on Canvas

### Grading Scale

| Grade | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **+** | Complete and near-perfect work |
| **✓** | Generally good work with clear effort shown but with some errors |
| **-** | Significantly incomplete work with major conceptual errors and little effort shown |

### Collaboration Policy

We strongly encourage collaboration between students on the problem sets. You may discuss problems with each other either in person or via the discussion forum. However, each student is expected to submit their own write-up of the answers and any relevant code.
